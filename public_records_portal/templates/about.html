				<h4 id="what">What is RecordTrac?</h4>
				<p>RecordTrac is a quick, simple way for you to submit a public records request to {{config['AGENCY_NAME']}}</p>  
				<p><strong>Every message or record uploaded on this site is completely public.</strong> This makes easier to understand what happens to every request.</p>
				<br>

				<h4 id="why">Why was RecordTrac made?</h4>

				<p>The 2013 Code for America fellows created RecordTrac with the City of Oakland. As public records requests became larger and more complex, city employees found coordinating a response to be difficult. The old software system no longer met their needs and many requests remained untracked.</p>
				<p>Members of the public complained they didn’t understand what happened after they submitted their requests and it took too long to get the records they needed.</p>
				<p>By making everything completely transparent, you can know your request is fulfilled.</p>
				<br>


				<h4 id="all request table">Where can I find all the requests submitted through RecordTrac?</h4>
				<p>RecordTrac displays all current and past records requests at <a href="{{config['APPLICATION_URL']}}requests">{{config['APPLICATION_URL']}}requests</a>. A description of what RecordTrac displays on this page can be found below:</p> 

				<div class="row-fluid">
					<div class="span1 offset1">
						<p class="table-legend">'#'</p>
					</div>
					<div class="span8">
						<p class="table-legend-explanation">Each request is assigned a unique number. You can easily track your request with this number by visiting <a href="{{config['APPLICATION_URL']}}track">{{config['APPLICATION_URL']}}track</a>.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row-fluid">
					<div class="span1 offset1">
						<p class="table-legend">'Received'</p>
					</div>
					<div class="span8">
						<p class="table-legend-explanation">This column displays the date when the request was entered in RecordTrac.</p>
						<p class="table-legend-explanation">You are allowed to submit a public records request any way, including by mail, fax, and over the phone. If a request wasn't originally submitted through RecordTrac, it may take agency employees a day or two to enter it into the system.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row-fluid">
					<div class="span1 offset1">
						<p class="table-legend">'Point of Contact'</p>
					</div>
					<div class="span8">
						<p class="table-legend-explanation">The 'Point of Contact' is a {{config['AGENCY_NAME']}} employee responsible for providing you with the information you need about your public records request.</p>
						<p class="table-legend-explanation">Sometimes {{config['AGENCY_NAME']}} employees from several departments will be needed to respond to one public records request. They will be added as Helpers.  In that case, if you have any questions about your request send a message to the Point of Contact through RecordTrac.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row-fluid">
					<div class="span1 offset1">
						<p class="table-legend">'Department'</p>
					</div>
					<div class="span8">
						<p class="table-legend-explanation">The agency department where the point of contact works. Multiple departments may be involved in one request, but the Point of Contact's department will only be displayed.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<br>


				<h4 id="show">Why can you show everyone my request?</h4>
				<p>The California Public Records Act and Oakland’s Sunshine Ordinance gives everyone access to documents, photos, emails, texts, audio recordings, and data about the {{config['AGENCY_NAME']}} and its business. This is why we can display your request and any responses from {{config['AGENCY_NAME']}} staff. To make you feel comfortable, we don't allow the public to view your name or contact information through this website. However, by submitting a request you are creating a public record, and information you include is requestable under the law.</p>

				<p>According to the Public Records Act, the {{config['AGENCY_NAME']}} must:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Help you locate the record</li>
				<li>Allow you to view the records immediately during business hours</li>
				<li>Respond within 10 days</li> 
				</ul>
				<p>The {{config['AGENCY_NAME']}} may ask for a 14-day extension if they have to sort through a large number of documents, retrieve the document from a facility outside of City Hall, consult with another agency, or write a computer program to get data.</p> 
				<p>

					<li><a href="http://www.oaklandcityattorney.org/resources/PubInfoRequest.html">City Attorney's website</a></li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<h4 id="documents">Why aren't all documents uploaded on RecordTrac?</h4>
				<p>The {{config['AGENCY_NAME']}} will not publicly release records or information that violates your right to privacy. This also includes records that will compromise your safety or the completion of a law enforcement investigation.</p>

				<p>For example, many police reports contain sensitive information that can only be sent to the individuals directly involved in the crime or incident, and will not be released through RecordTrac. You will, however, better understand the number and types of records requests processed, even when the record itself cannot be uploaded due to sensitive data.</p>   
				<br>
				<h4 id="redeploy">What should I do if I want my agency to use RecordTrac?</h4>
				<p>RecordTrac is an open-source software project that can be redeployed by any municipality. If you want to reuse RecordTrac, we'd love to hear from you. Visit our sign-up page by <a href="http://www.recordtrac.com">clicking here</a>.</p>
